# PHP Tracing

## Overview

The PHP tracing feature automatically instruments APIs, frameworks, and application servers for the applications built using PHP. The sfAPM PHP agent collects and sends the tracing metrics and the correlated application logs to the SnappyFlow server and you can view the tracing data in SnappyFlow's dashboard.
