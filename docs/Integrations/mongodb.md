# Monitoring Mongo Database

## Overview

MongoDB plugin is an sfAgent plugin used to collect mongodb metrics. It uses serverStatus, dbstats command to retrieve the statistics. If replication is enabled and in cluster mode(replicaset) then collects the replication information.

**Support monitoring on:**

1. Standalone mode
2. Cluster (replicaset) mode

# **MongoDB Monitoring in Standalone mode**

## Prerequisites

1. sfAgent requires access to MongoDB system tables to collect metrics. This will require adding user credentials to sfAgent plugin configuration.  User role and credentials can be created with the procedure mentioned below

   - Open `/etc/mongod.conf` file and comment security config if it exists. This is needed to make changes to config file and will be uncommented in subsequent step

     ```
      #security: 
               #authorization: enabled
     ```

   - Start mongodb service with command `service mongod start`

   - Check mongodb status is active using command `service mongod status`

   - Create `mongostatRole` and `listDatabases` roles

     - Use admin

     - Execute the command below

       ```sql
       db.createRole(
          {
                  role: "mongostatRole",
                  privileges: [
                  { resource: { cluster: true }, 
                    actions: [ "serverStatus" ] }],
                  roles: []
          })
       
       db.createRole(
           {
                   role: "listDatabases",
                   privileges: [
                   { resource: { cluster: true }, 
                   actions: [ "listDatabases" ] }],
                   roles: []
               })
       ```

       

   2. Create new user with `clusterMonitor` , `mongostatRole` and `listDatabases` roles

      ```sql
      db.createUser( { user:"Newuser", pwd: "pass",
                     roles : [
                         { role : "mongostatRole", db : "admin"  },
                         { role : "listDatabases", db :"admin" },
                         { role : "clusterMonitor", db : "admin" }           
                 ] } )
      ```

   3. Exit mongo using `exit` command

   4. Open `/etc/mongod.conf` file and uncomment security config if exists else add the config

      ```
      security:
                   authorization: enabled
      ```

   5. Restart mongodb using command `service mongod restart` 

   6. Use the created mongo user credentials in sfagent config and start sfagent

## Configuration

sfAgent section provides steps to install and automatically generate plugin configurations.  User can also manually add the configuration shown below to `config.yaml` under `/opt/sfagent/` directory.

```yaml
key: <Profile_key>
tags:
  Name: <instance_name>
  appName: <app_name>
  projectName: <project_name>
metrics:
  plugins:
    - name: mongodb
      enabled: true
      interval: 300
      config:
        port: 27017
        host: localhost
        username: Newuser
        password: pass
```

# **MongoDB Monitoring in cluster(replicaset) mode**

MongoDB cluster is a set of nodes that are primary and secondary nodes. The nodes are synced and maintain same data in all the nodes in the replicaset type. The synchronization and the node information are collected about the cluster.

Install the agent on all the nodes in the cluster, both the primary nodes and the secondary nodes.

**Supported on:** MongoDB version 5.0

**There are four documentTypes related to the replication:**

1. nodeDetails 

2. replicationMemberDetails 

3. replicationSyncDetails 

4. oplogDetails 

 ### Pre-requisites

**Note: The replication should be the replicaset based replication.** 

1. sfAgent requires access to MongoDB system tables to collect metrics. This will require adding user credentials to sfAgent plugin configuration.  User role and credentials can be created with the procedure mentioned below


- Open `/etc/mongod.conf` file and comment security config if it exists. This is needed to make changes to config file and will be uncommented in subsequent step

  ```
   #security: 
            #authorization: enabled
  ```

- Start mongodb service with command `service mongod start`

- Check mongodb status is active using command `service mongod status`

- Create `mongostatRole` and `listDatabases` roles

  - Use admin

  - Execute the command below

    ```sql
    db.createRole(
       {
               role: "mongostatRole",
               privileges: [
               { resource: { cluster: true }, 
                 actions: [ "serverStatus" ] }],
               roles: []
       })
    
    db.createRole(
        {
                role: "listDatabases",
                privileges: [
                { resource: { cluster: true }, 
                actions: [ "listDatabases" ] }],
                roles: []
            })
    ```

    

2. Create new user with `clusterMonitor` , `mongostatRole` and `listDatabases` roles

   ```sql
   db.createUser( { user:"Newuser", pwd: "pass",
                  roles : [
                      { role : "mongostatRole", db : "admin"  },
                      { role : "listDatabases", db :"admin" },

              ] } )
   ```

3. Exit mongo using `exit` command

4. Open `/etc/mongod.conf` file and uncomment security config if exists else add the config

   ```
   security:
