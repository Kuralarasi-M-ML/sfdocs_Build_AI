# Monitor Nginx on Instances

## Overview

Nginx monitoring involves monitoring of the following elements: 

- Nginx Access Logs
- Nginx Error Logs 

- Nginx Server Health 

## Pre-requisites 

### Access Log Format
Nginx access log monitoring from multi domain configuration is supported. Ensure Nginx access logs are in format expected by sfAgent parser. Edit nginx conf file, conf file can be `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf, /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default, /etc/nginx/conf.d/custom.conf`  and set log format as follows: 	

```
'$remote_addr $remote_user [$time_local] '  
'"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent ' 
'"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" ua="$upstream_addr" ' 
'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time'; 
```

Sample: 

```
log_format snappyflow '$remote_addr $remote_user [$time_local] '
                      '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                      '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" ua="$upstream_addr" '
                      'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time';

access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log snappyflow buffer=16k flush=5s;
```

After configuring log format, the expected log entry would be: 

```
172.31.72.81 - [01/Jul/2020:03:36:04 +0000] "POST /owners/6/edit HTTP/1.1" 504 167 "-" "Apache-HttpClient/4.5.7 (Java/1.8.0_252)" ua="-" rt=60.004 uct=- uht=- urt=60.004 
```

### Description of the Log Fields 

| **Log Field**  | **Description**                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **remote_addr**    |          Client address                                    |
| **remote_user** | Number of disk blocks read in this database. |
| **time_local** | Time when the log entry is written. |
| **request** | Full original request line. |
| **status** |  Response status code. |
| **body_bytes_sent** |  Number of bytes sent to a client (not counting the response header). |
| **http_referer** |  Client request header field 'Referer'. |
| **http_user_agent** | Client request header field 'User-agent'.|
| **upstream_addr** |  Keeps the IP address and port, or the path to the UNIX-domain socket of the upstream server. |
| **request_time** |   Request processing time in seconds with a milliseconds resolution; time elapsed between the first bytes were read from the client and the log write after the last bytes were sent to the client. |
| **upstream_connect_time** | Keeps time spent on establishing a connection with the upstream server, in seconds with millisecond resolution.|
| **upstream_header_time** |  Keeps time spent on receiving the response header from the upstream server, in seconds with millisecond resolution.  |
| **upstream_response_time** | Keeps time spent on receiving the response from the upstream server, in seconds with millisecond resolution. |


### Optional fields supported

 1. **remote_port**:  Client port. Add after the remote_addr field as follows:

    ```
    log_format snappyflow '$remote_addr:$remote_port $remote_user [$time_local] '
                          '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                          '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" ua="$upstream_addr" '
                          'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time';
                                                
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log snappyflow buffer=16k flush=5s;
    ```

    

 2. **request_length**:  Request length including request line, header, and request body. Add it in the end after $upstream_response_time as follows:

    ```
    log_format snappyflow  '$remote_addr $remote_user [$time_local] '
                        '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                        '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" ua="$upstream_addr" '
                        'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time rs=$request_length';
                                              
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log snappyflow buffer=16k flush=5s;
    ```

    

3. **host**: Host field extracts the domain name from access logs. Incorporate the following log format into the configuration file to enable the host field.

   ```
   '$remote_addr $remote_user [$time_local] host=$host '  
   '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
   '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" ua="$upstream_addr" '
   'rt=$request_time uct=$upstream_connect_time uht=$upstream_header_time urt=$upstream_response_time'; 
   ```

   

### Nginx Status Module

**Enable Nginx status module:** This is required to monitor Nginx server health 

Open source Nginx exposes several basic metrics about server activity on a simple status page, provided that you have HTTP Stub Status Module enabled. To check if the module is already enabled, run: 

   ```shell
   nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o with-http_stub_status_module 
   ```

The status module is enabled if you see **with-http_stub_status_module** as output in the terminal. 

In order to enable mod_status , you will need to enable the status module. You can use the --with-http_stub_status_module configuration parameter when building Nginx from source: 

   ```shell
     ./configure \ 
      … \ 
      --with-http_stub_status_module 
      make 
      sudo make install
   ```

After verifying the module is enabled, you will also need to modify your Nginx configuration to set up a locally accessible URL (e.g., /stats) for the status page: 

   ```
    server { 
        location /stats { 
          stub_status; 
          access_log off; 
          allow 127.0.0.1; 
          deny all; 
        } 
      } 
   ```

   

:::note

 The server blocks of Nginx config are usually found not in the master configuration file (e.g., /etc/nginx/nginx.conf) but in supplemental configuration files that are referenced by the master config. To find the relevant configuration files, first locate the master config by running: 

`nginx -t` 

Open the master configuration file listed, and look for lines that begin with “include” near the end of the http block, e.g.: 

`include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`

In one of the referenced config files you should find the main server block, which you can modify as above to configure Nginx metrics reporting. After changing any configurations, reload the configs by executing: 

`nginx -s reload`

After modifying any configuration restart Nginx service by executing:

`systemctl restart nginx`

Now you can view the status page to see your metrics: 
[http://127.0.0.1/stats](http://127.0.0.1/stats)

## Configuration 

[sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) section provides steps to install and automatically generate plugin configurations. User can also manually add the configuration shown below to config.yaml under /opt/sfagent/ directory.

```yaml
key: <profile key> 
generate_name: true 
tags: 
  Name: <unique instance name or will be generated from IP> 
  appName: <add application name> 
  projectName: <add project name> 
metrics: 
  plugins: 
    - name: nginx 
      enabled: true 
      interval: 300 
      config: 
        port: 80 
        secure: false 
        location: stats 
logging: 
  plugins: 
    - name: nginx-access 
      enabled: true 
      config: 
        geo_info: true  
        log_path: /var/log/nginx/access.log, /var/log/nginx/access_log 
        ua_parser: true 
    - name: nginx-error 
      enabled: true 
      config: 
        log_level: 
          - emerg 
          - alert 
          - error 
        log_path: /var/log/nginx/error.log, /var/log/nginx/error_log 
```

#### Nginx Access Log Options

1. Geo-IP: Useful to find geographical location of the client using the IP address. To enable, set the option "geo_info" to true in the above configuration.
2. User-Agent Analysis: To get the host machine details like browser, Operating system and device by analysis the user-agent. To enable, set the option "ua_parser" to true in the above configuration. If enabled, by default it runs on port 8586.
3. URL Normalizer (not supported in container deployment): Normalize incoming URL paths. To enable, set the option "url_normalizer" to true in the above configuration. If enabled, by default it runs on port 8587. 

Normalization specific configuration is available in `/opt/sfagent/normalization/config.yaml` which resonate the following:

```yaml
interval: 300
dynamic_rule_generation:
  enabled: true
  rules_length_limit: 1000 
  log_volume: 100000
rules: []
```

#### Config Field Description

**interval**: Normalization algorithm runtime interval.

**enabled**: Rely on normalization feature for rule generation.

**rules_length_limit**: Limit over size of generated rules. set the value to -1  for specifying no limit.

**log_volume**: Limit over number of logs processed. set the value to -1  for specifying no limit.

**rules**: Rules Generated.

Recommended approach is to run sfagent with *dynamic_rule_generation* enabled over a period of time. Observe whether rules generated reflect all the web app requests intended to be normalized and if its a true reflection, set *enabled* flag to *false* , indicating no further rules will be generated

Default ports used by user-agent analysis and URL Normalizer can be changed respectively with the inclusion of following in config.yaml

```yaml
agent:
  uaparserport: port_number
  url_normalizer: port_number
```

:::note

1. Latitude and Longitude are often near the center of population. These values are not precise and should not be used to identify a particular address or household.

2. User-agent parsing requires high computation power. Recommended to enable only if needed and system have enough CPU resource available.

#### Enhance URL Normalization

Refer the following document for comprehensive instructions and guidelines for setting up and developing rules to enhance URL normalization.

## Viewing data and dashboards 

- Data generated by plugin can be viewed in “browse data” page inside the respective application under `plugin=nginx` with `documentType=` `serverDetails`, `serverStats` and `plugin=nginx-access` with `documentType=nginxAccessLogs`.
- Dashboard for this data can be instantiated by Importing dashboard template `Nginx_Server`, `Nginx_Access` to the application dashboard.
