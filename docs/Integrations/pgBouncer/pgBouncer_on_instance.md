# PgBouncer Integration

**PgBouncer** acts as a connection pool mechanism for **PostgreSQL**. PgBouncer creates a connection pool and enables the application to use the existing connections in the pool to interact with the database. 

The number of PostgreSQL backend processes can be reduced by this mechanism. PgBouncer reduces the resource (memory, backend, fork, etc..) consumption of the PostgreSQL. It also decreases the response time between the client application and the database.

By integrating PgBouncer with SnappyFlow, you enable SnappyFlow to collect the connection metrics from PgBouncer and visualize them in SnappyFlow's dashboard.

##  PgBouncer Monitoring

PgBouncer running on Linux can be monitored using Snappyflow sfagent. Refer to the link for installation of sfagent https://docs.snappyflow.io/docs/Integrations/os/linux/sfagent_linux.

:::note

PgBouncer version 1.12 and above can be monitored.

PgBouncer monitoring is tested on version 1.12.

:::

### **Pre-Requisites**

**PgBouncer admin and stats user configuration.**

Configure the pgbouncer user as admin and stats user by adding the below lines in the `pgbouncer.ini config` file.

The default location of the pgbouncer configuration file is `/etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini.`

Execute the following command in the Pgbouncer configuration file.

```
admin_users = <username>

stats_users =  <username>
```

**Add ignore startup parameters**

By default, PgBouncer allows only the parameters it can keep track of in the startup packets: **`client_encoding`**, **`datestyle`**, **`timezone`**, and **`standard_conforming_strings`**. All other parameters will raise an error. To allow other parameters, ignore startup parameters command is used. 

Example: `ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits`

## Configurationâ€¯

Add the following configuration to the *config.yaml* file: 


```yaml 
key: <profile key> 
tags: 
  Name: <unique instance name or will be generated from IP> 
  appName: <add application name> 
  projectName: <add project name> 
metrics: 
  plugins: 
    - name: pgbouncer
      enabled: true 
      interval: 30
      config:
      	port: <port>
      	host: <host/IP>
      	user: <username>
      	password: <password>
```
