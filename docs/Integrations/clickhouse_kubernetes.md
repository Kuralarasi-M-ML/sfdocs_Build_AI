# Monitor Clickhouse Database

Clickhouse database can be monitored in SnappyFlow using Prometheus exporter.

:::note

The configurations given below apply only to the Clickhouse running on an instance.

## Clickhouse monitoring with Prometheus

Refer to Prometheus Exporter overview to understand how SnappyFlow monitors using Prometheus exporters.

 ### Pre-requisites

 Prometheus exporter is deployed as a side-car in the application container and the exporter port is accessible to sfPod

| OSIOWaitMicroseconds  |   Total time a thread spent waiting for a result of IO operation, from the OS point of view. This is real IO that doesn't include page cache. |
| UserTimeMicroseconds  |   Total time spent in processing (queries and other tasks) threads executing CPU instructions in user space. This include time CPU pipeline was stalled due to cache misses, branch mispredictions, hyper-threading, etc. |
| OSWriteBytes  |    Number of bytes written to disks or block devices. Doesn't include bytes that are in page cache dirty pages. May not include data that was written by OS asynchronously. |
| QueryDuration  (Prom Metric: chi_clickhouse_event_RealTimeMicroseconds)  |    Total (wall clock) time spent in processing (queries and other tasks) threads (not that this is a sum). |

| ZooKeeperUserExceptions  |   ZooKeeper User Exceptions |
| BackgroundDistributedSchedulePoolTask   |  Number of active tasks in          BackgroundDistributedSchedulePool. This pool is used for distributed sends that is done in background. |
| BackgroundMovePoolTask  |  Number of active tasks in BackgroundProcessingPool for moves |
| BackgroundSchedulePoolTask  |  Number of active tasks in BackgroundSchedulePool. This pool is used for periodic ReplicatedMergeTree tasks, like cleaning old data parts, altering data parts, replica re-initialization, etc |
| ContextLocks  |  Number of times the lock of Context was acquired or tried to acquire. This is global lock. |
| ContextLockWait  |  Number of threads waiting for lock in Context. This is global lock. |
| GlobalThreadActive  |  Number of threads in global thread pool running a task. |
| GlobalThreadTotal  |  Number of threads in global thread pool.    |
| LocalThreadActive  |  Number of threads in local thread pools running a task. |
| LocalThreadTotal  |  Number of threads in local thread pool.    |
| PartMutation  |  Number of mutations (ALTER DELETE/UPDATE) |

| jemalloc_background_thread_num_runs |  |
| MaxPartCountForPartition  |  |
| MemoryTrackingForMerges    |  Total amount of memory (bytes) allocated for background merges. Included in MemoryTrackingInBackgroundProcessingPool. Note that this value may include a drift when the memory was allocated in a context of background processing pool and freed in other context or vice-versa. This happens naturally due to caches for tables indexes and doesn't indicate memory leaks. |
| ZooKeeperWaitMicroseconds |  |
| ArenaAllocBytes  |  |
