# Monitor ElastiCache

## Overview
ElastiCache is the distributed in memory cache environments in the AWS cloud. Amazon ElastiCache supports the Memcached and Redis cache engines.

## Prerequisites:

### CloudWatch Access for IAM Role 

Provide Read only access for CloudWatch to the dedicated IAM Role used for APM. You can use AWS managed polices that addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS. Attach this AWS policy **CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess** to IAM role to get read access for all CloudWatch else create the below custom policy and attach it to IAM.

**Required Permissions:**

- cloudwatch:GetMetricData,
- elasticache: ListTagsForResource,
- elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters,
- elasticache:DescribeEvent

To monitor remote services like Elasticache we use sfpoller.  when using a SaaS based snappyflow one can use sfpoller or use tag based discovery on SaaS portal.

## sfPoller Configuration

Select *ElastiCache* Endpoint Type in  *Add Endpoints* and add the Cluster Name

- Add Endpoint<br/><br/>

 <img src="/img/add_endpoint.png" />

- Select ElastiCache Endpoint<br/><br/>

  <img src="/img/endpoint_type.png" /><br/><br/>


- Enter the ClusterName<br/><br/>

 <img src="/img/cluster_name.png" /><br/><br/>

Select the plugin from the dropdown under Plugins tab and config the polling interval. Plugin configuration for ElastiCache services this includes cloudwatch-elasticache-redis and cloudwatch-elasticache-memcached plugin. You can enable/disable any of the plugin based on your needs and instance support.

**cloudwatch-elasticache-redis**:

a monitoring support for AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster, collects all the hostlevel, node level and operational stats of a redis cluster.

**cloudwatch-elasticache-memcached:**

a monitoring support for AWS ElastiCache memcached Cluster, collects all the hostlevel, system level and operational stats of a memcached cluster.
