# Monitor Postgres DB on Instance

## Overview

PostgreSQL on instances is monitored using [sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) configured with Postgres plugin.

## Get Started

To get started with PostgreSQL integration, create a user and grant permissions to collect data from your PostgreSQL server.

### Create New User

Create a read-only user with the following command:

```shell
create user <username> with password '<password>';
```

:::note

Use the username and password created in this section while setting access permission and configuration.

:::

### Set Access Permission

For version 10.0 or greater, use the below code to set access permission.

```shell
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to <username>; 
grant pg_monitor to <username>; 
```

For older versions, use the below code to set access permission.
``` shell
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to <username>;
```

:::note

By default, these permissions are granted to the root user

:::

## Configuration

Refer to [sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) section for steps to install and automatically generate plugin configurations. User can also manually add the configuration shown below to `config.yaml` under `/opt/sfagent/ directory`.

```yaml
key: <profile_key> 
tags: 
  Name: <name> 
  appName: <app_name> 
  projectName: <project_name> 
metrics: 
  plugins: 
    - name: postgres 
      enabled: true 
      interval: 60 
      config: 
        documentsTypes: 
          - databaseDetails 
          - indexDetails 
          - queryDetails 
          - serverDetails 
          - tableDetails 
        host: 127.0.0.1 
        password: <password> 
        port: 5432 
        user: <username> 
logging: 
  plugins: 
    - name: postgres-general 
      enabled: true 
      config: 
        log_level: 
          - error 
          - warning 
          - info 
          - log 
        log_path: /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10-main.log 
    - name: postgres-slowquery 
      enabled: true 
      config: 
        log_path: /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10-main.log 
```

## Enable Logs
### Enable PostgreSQL general logs
It is required to configure **`PostgreSQL.conf`** file to enable PostgreSQL logs. To locate the **`PostgreSQL.conf`**, execute the following command:

```
postgres=# show config_file; 
           config_file             
---------------------------------- 
 /data/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf 
(1 row) 
```

Update the **`Postgresql.conf`** file with the variables shown below:
```
log_min_messages = warning  # set level as appropriate 
log_line_prefix = '< %m > ' 
```

**Example**:

once the logs are enabled, PostgreSQL general logs will be generated in the below format.

```
< 2023-05-04 11:52:10.470 IST > LOG:  duration: 1006.577 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1);
```



### Enable PostgreSQL Slow Query logs

To enable PostgreSQL slow query logs, update the **`PostgreSQL.conf`** file with the variables shown below:

`log_min_duration_statement = 200`
