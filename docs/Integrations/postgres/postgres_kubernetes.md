# Monitor Postgres DB in Kubernetes

## Overview 

PostgreSQL running in Kubernetes can be monitored in SnappyFlow using two approaches: 

- [sfKubeAgent](/docs/integrations/kubernetes/sfkubeagent_installation)  as a sidecar container
- [Prometheus exporter](/docs/integrations/kubernetes/prometheus_exporter) 

## Get Started

To get started with PostgreSQL integration, create a user and grant permissions to collect data from your PostgreSQL server.

### Create New User

Create a read-only user with the following command:

```shell
create user <username> with password '<password>';
```

:::note

Use the username and password created in this section while setting access permission and configuration.

:::

### Set Access Permission

For version 10.0 or greater, use the below code to set access permission.

```shell
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to <username>; 
grant pg_monitor to <username>; 
```

For older versions, use the below code to set access permission.

``` shell
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to <username>;
```

:::note

By default, these permissions are granted to the root user.

## PostgreSQL monitoring with sfKubeAgent

sfKubeAgent run as a sidecar with the `configMap` shown below. The `configmap` initiates plugins for metrics, general logs, and slow queries. 

 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 
kind: ConfigMap 
metadata: 
  name: postgres-configmap 
data: 
  config.yaml: |- 
    key: <profile_key> 
    metrics: 
      plugins: 
      - name: postgres 
        enabled: true 
        interval: 60 
        config: 
          documentsTypes:    #user can enable all or only needed documents 
            - databaseDetails 
            - indexDetails8 
            - queryDetails 
            - serverDetails 
            - tableDetails 
          host: 127.0.0.1 
          user: <userName> 
          password: <password> 
          port: 5432 
    logging: 
      plugins: 
      - name: postgres-general 
        enabled: true 
        config: 
          log_level: 
            - error 
            - warning 
            - info 
            - log 
          log_path: /var/log/postgres/*.log 
      - name: postgres-slowquery 
        enabled: true 
        config: 
          log_path: /var/log/postgres/*.log 
```

**Example**: PostgreSQL pod that contains both Postgres and sfKubeAgent containers.

```yaml
kind: Pod 
apiVersion: v1 
metadata: 
 name: postgres-pod 
 labels: 
  snappyflow/appname: <app_name> 
  snappyflow/projectname: <project_name> 
spec: 
 containers: 
 - name: postgres-container 
   securityContext: {} 
   image: "postgres:9.6" 
   args: ["-c", "log_statement=all", "-c", "log_min_messages=warning", "-c", "log_min_duration_statement=200", "-c","log_directory=/var/log/postgres","-c","log_line_prefix=< %m > ","-c","log_filename=postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log","-c","log_truncate_on_rotation=off","-c","log_rotation_age=1d","-c","logging_collector=on"] 
   imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
   ports: 
   - name: tcp 
     containerPort: 5432 
     protocol: TCP 
   env: 
   - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD 
     value: <password> 
   - name: POSTGRES_USER 
     value: <userName> 
   volumeMounts: 
     - name: varlog 
       mountPath: /var/log/postgres 
   # Snappyflow's sfkubeagent container 
 - name: sfagent-container 
   image: snappyflowml/sfagent:latest 
   imagePullPolicy: Always 
   command: 
     - /app/sfagent 
     - -enable-console-log 
   env: 
     - name: APP_NAME 
       value: <app_name> 
     - name: PROJECT_NAME 
       value: <project_name> 
   volumeMounts: 
     - name: configmap-postgres 
       mountPath: /opt/sfagent/config.yaml 
       subPath: config.yaml 
     - name: varlog 
       mountPath: /var/log/postgres 
 volumes: 
 - name: configmap-postgres 
   configMap: 
     name: postgres-configmap 
 - name: varlog 
   emptyDir: {} 
```



## PostgreSQL monitoring with Prometheus 

Refer to [Prometheus Exporter](/docs/integrations/kubernetes/prometheus_exporter) overview to understand how SnappyFlow monitors using Prometheus exporters. 

### Prerequisites 

Prometheus exporter should have been deployed as a side-car in the application container and the exporter port should accessible to the sfPod.

### Configuration 

```yaml
kind: Pod 
apiVersion: v1 
metadata: 
 name: postgres-pod 
 labels: 
  snappyflow/appname: <app_name> 
  snappyflow/projectname: <project_name> 
  snappyflow/component: postgresql 
spec: 
 containers: 
 - name: postgres-exporter 
   image: bitnami/postgres-exporter 
   ports: 
   - name: pg-exporter 
     containerPort: 9187 
   command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"] 
   args: ['DATA_SOURCE_NAME="postgresql://<user_name>:<password>@localhost:5432/<dbname>?sslmode=disable" /opt/bitnami/postgres-exporter/bin/postgres_exporter'] 
 - name: postgres-container 
   securityContext: {} 
   image: "postgres:9.6" 
   args: ["-c", "log_statement=all", "-c", "log_min_messages=warning", "-c", "log_min_duration_statement=200", "-c","log_line_prefix=< %m > "] 
   imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
   ports: 
   - name: tcp 
     containerPort: 5432 
     protocol: TCP 
   env: 
   - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD 
     value: <password> 
   - name: POSTGRES_USER 
     value: <user_name> 
   - name: POSTGRES_DB 
     value: <dbname> 
```

## PostgreSQL Pod Centralized Logging 

Refer to [Centralized Logging Overview](/docs/integrations/kubernetes/centralized_logging_of_application_pod_logs) to understand how SnappyFlow implements centralized logging. The centralized logging approach requires the application pod to stream logs to stdout, which is achieved by running a busy box container as shown below. 

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: postgres-pod
  labels:
    snappyflow/appname: <app_name>
    snappyflow/projectname: <project_name>
    snappyflow/component: postgresql
spec:
  containers:
    - name: postgres-exporter
      image: bitnami/postgres-exporter
      ports:
        - name: pg-exporter
          containerPort: 9187
      command:
        - /bin/sh
        - '-c'
      args:
        - >-
          DATA_SOURCE_NAME="postgresql://<user_name>:<password>@localhost:5432/<dbname>?sslmode=disable"
          /opt/bitnami/postgres-exporter/bin/postgres_exporter
    - name: postgres-container
      securityContext: {}
      image: 'postgres:9.6'
      args:
        - '-c'
        - log_statement=all
        - '-c'
        - log_min_messages=warning
        - '-c'
        - log_min_duration_statement=200
        - '-c'
        - 'log_line_prefix=< %m > '
        - '-c'
        - log_directory=/var/log/postgres
        - '-c'
        - log_filename=postgresql.log
        - '-c'
        - logging_collector=on
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      ports:
        - name: tcp
          containerPort: 5432
          protocol: TCP
      env:
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          value: <password>
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          value: <user_name>
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: <dbname>
      volumeMounts:
        - name: postgres-log
          mountPath: /var/log/postgres
    - name: postgres-general
      image: busybox
      command:
        - /bin/sh
        - '-c'
      args:
        - tail -n+1 -f /var/log/postgres/*.log
      volumeMounts:
        - name: postgres-log
          mountPath: /var/log/postgres
  volumes:
    - name: postgres-log
      emptyDir: {}
```

## View Database Metrics and Logs
