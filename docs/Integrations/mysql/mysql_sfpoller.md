## Prerequisites

To collect metrics of Postgres DB hosted on AWS, it is necessary to have a sfpoller set up within your AWS environment.

[Click here](/docs/sfPoller/aws_setup) to learn more about setting up sfpoller in your AWS environment.

## Configure sfPoller

Ensure that both the project and application are created within sfPoller. If they have not been created yet, you can [click here](/docs/sfPoller/aws_setup#configure-sfpoller) to learn how to create a project and application in sfPoller.

The video below explains the steps involved in setting up sfPoller to monitor a MySQL database running on AWS.
