## Prerequisites

To collect metrics of Aurora DB, it is necessary to have an IAM Role with CloudWatch access and sfpoller set up within your AWS environment.

##### Create a Policy to Access CloudWatch

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. Follow the below steps to create a policy in the IAM console.
