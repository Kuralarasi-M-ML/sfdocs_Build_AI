# Monitor Aurora-PostgreSQL DB

## Prerequisites

Ensure that both the project and application are created within sfPoller. If they have not been created yet, you can [click here](/docs/sfPoller/aws_setup#configure-sfpoller) to learn how to create a project and application in sfPoller.

## Configure sfPoller to Collect Metrics

Follow the below step to add endpoints and plugins:

<img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_1.png" />

1. In the **Application** tab of sfPoller, navigate to your **Project** > **Application**.

2. Click on the **Application**, it will take you to the `Endpoint` page.

   <img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_2.png" />

3. Click the `Add Endpoint` button, add the following data, and save.

   <img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_3.png" />

   - **Service Type**: Select AWS Service

   - **Name**: Give a meaningful name to the endpoint

   - **IP/Endpoint**: Add the application IP

   - **Instance Name**: Give the Instance name of your application

   <img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_5.png" />

4. In the **Plugins** window, click the `+Add` button.

   <img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_4.png" />

5. In the **Add Plugin** window, select the below details and save.

   - **Plugin Type**: `Metric` 

   - **Plugin**: `cloudwatch-aurora` or  `cloudwatch-aurorapostgresinsights`

   - **Interval**: Choose an interval value. The minimum value for the interval is 300

   - **Status**: By default, the status is `Enabled`

6. Click the global `Save` button in the window's top right corner to save all the changes made so far.

## Configure sfPoller to Collect Logs

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that the aurorapostgresql slow query logs are enabled for the instance. Please refer to the following document to learn how to enable the aurorapostgresql slow query logs.

​         [RDS for PostgreSQL database log files - Amazon Relational Database Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.html)

- The following parameter groups are mandatory to add when enabling the slow query logs.
  
  <br/>
  
  |Parameter Group                                 |Description|
  |----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
  |log_min_duration_sample |(ms) Sets  the minimum execution time above which a sample of statements is logged.  Sample size is set using the log_statement_sample_rate parameter.|
  | log_min_duration_statement | Any SQL  statement that runs atleast for the specified amount of time or longer gets  logged. By default, this parameter isn't set. Turning on this parameter can  help you find unoptimized queries. |
  | log_statement_sample_rate | The  percentage of statements exceeding the time specified in log_min_duration_sample to be logged, expressed as a floating point value between 0.0 and  1.0 |
  
- Publish the database logs to the Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Please refer to the following document to learn how to publish the database logs to the Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

   [Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs - Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch.html)

   - **Engine**: `postgresql`

   - **Interval**: Choose an interval value. The minimum value for the interval is 300

   - **Status**: By default, the status is `Enabled`

6. Click the global `Save` button in the window's top right corner to save all the changes made so far.



## View Database Metrics and Logs

Follow the below steps to view the metrics collected from Aurora DB.

1. Go to the **Application** tab in SnappyFlow and navigate to your **Project** > **Application** > **Dashboard**.

   <img src="/img/integration/auroradb/image_6.png" />

2. You can view the database metrics and the slow query logs in the **Metrics** section.

:::note

Once plugins are added to sfPoller, they will be automatically detected within the Metrics section. However, if the plugins are not detected, you can import templates to view the corresponding metrics.

:::

3. To access the unprocessed data gathered from the plugins, navigate to the **Browse data** section and choose the `Index: Metric or Logger`, `Instance: Endpoint`, `Plugin`, and `Document Type`.
