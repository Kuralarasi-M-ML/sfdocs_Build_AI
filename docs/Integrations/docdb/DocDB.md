# Monitor Document Database

## Overview

Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale MongoDB-compatible databases in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

### CloudWatch Access for IAM Role
Provide Read only access for CloudWatch to the dedicated IAM Role used for APM. You can use AWS managed polices that addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS. Attach this AWS policy CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess to IAM role to get read access for all CloudWatch.

### AmazonDocDBReadOnlyAccess
Provides read-only access to Amazon DocDB with MongoDB compatibility. Note that this policy also grants access to Amazon RDS and Amazon Neptune resources.

**Required Permissions:**

- "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
- "rds:DescribeDBInstances"
- "rds:ListTagsForResource"
- "rds:DescribeCertificates"


## SF Poller Configuration

Select DocumentDB Endpoint Type in Add Endpoints and add the Cluster ID

Select the plugin from the dropdown under Plugins tab and config the polling interval. Plugin configuration for DocumentDB services this includes cloudwatch-docdb plugin. You can enable/disable any of the plugin based on your needs and instance support.

**cloudwatch-docdb:**
A monitoring support for AWS DocuemntDB Cluster, collects all the cluster level and instance level metrics.

## Metrics list:

| DatabaseCursorsTimedOut	| The number of cursors that timed out in a one-minute period.| 
| FreeableMemory | 	The amount of available random access memory, in bytes.| 
| FreeLocalStorage | 	This metric reports the amount of storage available to each instance for temporary tables and logs.| 
| LowMemThrottleQueueDepth| 	The queue depth for requests that are throttled due to low available memory taken at a one-minute frequency.| 
| LowMemThrottleMaxQueueDepth| 	The maximum queue depth for requests that are throttled due to low available memory in a one-minute period.| 
| LowMemNumOperationsThrottled	| The number of requests that are throttled due to low available memory in a one-minute period.|
