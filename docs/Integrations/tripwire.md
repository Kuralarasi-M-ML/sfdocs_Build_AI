## Configuration Settings

Refer to [sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) section for steps to install and automatically generate plugin configurations. you can also manually add the configuration shown below to `config.yaml` under `/opt/sfagent` directory


```yaml

  metrics:

    - name: tripwire
      enabled: true
      interval: 300
      config:
        report_path: /var/lib/tripwire/report
