    This option will replace all instance tags with applied bundle config tags (Name, appName, tagName are mandatory tags).    
2. Insert/Update tags 

    - If a tag is already present in instance config and in bundle config, the bundle config file overrides the existing tags. 
    - If a tag is present in bundle config and not present in instance config, the tag which is present in bundle config will be added as a new tag. 
    - If a tag is present in instance config and not present in bundle config, the tag is retained from instance config. 
    - If the user wants to update only appName and projectName,  the user must remove the Name tag from the config file and upload it. The name field will be retained from the existing config file. 
    - Users can also add custom tags. 

3. Delete Tags: 

    This will remove the custom tags from the configuration file, but the tags that which user wants to delete should be present in both bundle config and instance config.
