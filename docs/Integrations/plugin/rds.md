# Monitor AWS RDS

## Description

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed SQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is web service designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications. Plugin will get RDS related metrics from CloudWatch to monitor the performance.

### Prerequisites

1. ##### CloudWatch Access for IAM Role

   Provide Read only access for CloudWatch to the dedicated IAM Role used for APM. You can use AWS managed polices that addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS. Attach this AWS policy **CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess** to IAM role to get read access for all CloudWatch else create the below custom policy and attach it to IAM.


   ```json
   {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
     {
      "Action": [
          "cloudwatch:Describe*",
          "cloudwatch:Get*",
          "cloudwatch:List*",
          "logs:Get*",
          "rds:Describe*",
          "logs:Describe*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
     }
    ]
   }
   ```

   

2. ##### Enable Performance Insights

   Enable Performance Insights for RDS (currently supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL) to collect insight metrics for RDS. We can enable while creating the RDS or click modify and edit . Please verify whether your RDS has support for [Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html) 

   Performance Insights is enabled when you choose Enable Performance Insights in the Performance Insights section . For more detailed information please refer [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Enabling.html#USER_PerfInsights.Console.Creating).

   

3. ##### Performance Insight Access for IAM Role

   To provide access to specific users, create the custom policy with access for Performance Insight and assign the policy to IAM user. 

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "pi:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:pi:*:*:metrics/rds/*"
      }
     ]
   }
   ```
