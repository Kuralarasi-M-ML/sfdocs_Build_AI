## SnappyFlow Dashboard

SnappyFlow's dashboard is a graphical user interface that displays real-time metrics and data about the performance of an application, system or network. The dashboard displays the data inform of  charts, graphs, and alerts that provide a comprehensive view of the application performance, allowing teams to quickly identify and troubleshoot the problems.

## SnappyFlow Dashboard UI

#### 1. Metrics

Metrics are the graphical representations of the data collected from your application. 
The SnappyFlow segregates the data based on the services in your application and enables you to visualize each set of data in a diagrams such as a bar chart, line chart, etc...

#### 2. Logs

**Logs** are the records of the events that have taken place within a system or application. These events include information such as errors, warnings, user actions, and system activities.

#### 3. Trace

Tracing is a process of tracking the Application programming interface (API) transactions within an application. The SnappyFlow collects and analysis the data such as how API requests are processed within the application, time taken to complete each request, errors occurred during the API request, and the dependencies between different components of the application. The transactions data are displayed on the SnappyFlow 's dashboard UI.



#### 4. Real User Monitoring 

**Real User Monitoring (RUM)** is a method of collecting performance data about a website or application directly from the end-user's web browser or mobile device. 

SnappyFlow's  RUM provides insights into the user experience including page load times, page rendering time, network latency, and other factors that can impact user satisfaction. Metrics such as Response time, Transactions, Errors, Event information, Browser information are monitored and visualized to help identify and troubleshoot website performance issues.

#### 5. Profiling

The SIEM system is designed to identify security events and incidents in real-time by analyzing log data from these sources.

Once the data is collected and analyzed, the SIEM feature assigns a severity level to each event based on its potential impact and the events are then displayed on SnappyFlow's dashboard.
