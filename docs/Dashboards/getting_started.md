## SnappyFlow Dashboard

SnappyFlow dashboard is a graphical user interface that displays real-time metrics and data about the performance of an application, system, or network. The dashboard displays the data in form of charts, graphs, and alerts that provide a comprehensive view of the application performance, allowing teams to quickly identify and troubleshoot the problems.

## SnappyFlow Dashboard UI

#### 1. Metrics

**Metrics** are the graphical representations of the data collected from your application. 

The SnappyFlow segregates the data based on the services in your application and enables you to visualize each set of data in a diagram such as a bar chart, line chart, etc...

#### 2. Logs

**Logs** are the records of the events that have taken place within a system or application. 

The SnappyFlow collects event information such as errors, warnings, user actions, and system activities and displays them in the dashboard UI.

#### 3. Trace

**Tracing** is a process of tracking the Application programming interface (API) transactions within an application. 

The SnappyFlow collects and analyzes the data such as how API requests are processed within the application, the time taken to complete each request, errors that occurred during the API request, and the dependencies between different application components. The transaction data are displayed on SnappyFlow 's dashboard UI.

#### 4. Real User Monitoring 

**Real User Monitoring (RUM)** collects performance data about a website or application directly from the end user's web browser or mobile device. 

SnappyFlow's  RUM provides insights into the user experience like page load times, page rendering time, network latency, and other factors that can impact user satisfaction. Metrics such as Response time, Transactions, Errors, Event information, and Browser information are monitored and visualized to help identify and troubleshoot website performance issues.

#### 5. Profiling

**Profiling** is known as visualizing the events in your machine that are occurring now. 

The SnappyFlow enables you to take a screenshot of code performance context. It also explores the memory usage and garbage collection of your application. With SnappyFlow profiling, you can identify slow or inefficient database queries, thread-locks, memory leaks, and unusual memory consumption.

#### 6. SIEM

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system is designed to identify real-time security events and incidents by analyzing log data from the sources. SnappyFlow's SIEM feature collects and analyzes security-related data from various sources, including network devices, servers, applications, and security controls like firewalls and antivirus software. 

Once the data is collected and analyzed, the SIEM feature assigns a severity level to each event based on its potential impact, and the events are then displayed on SnappyFlow's dashboard.

#### 7. Alerts

**Alerts** are the signals triggered when the event running in the application exceeds the predefined thresholds or rules that are set by the user. When an alert is triggered SnappyFlow notifies you by sending a notification to external communication/collaboration tools like Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and various Incident Management tools.

#### 8. Browse Data

**Browse Data** refers to the raw data collected in the SnappyFlow database. It allows the user to access the raw data by filtering the data using the following parameters as Index, Instance, Plugin, and Document type.

#### 9. Timeline

The **timeline** feature displays the time stamp of the data points visible in the users' dashboard UI. It also allows the user to view the data in a selected time range. It helps the users to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns in the data.

#### 10. Template

The **Template** is a pre-designed layout that serves as a starting point for creating a new dashboard. This can save time and effort, especially when creating multiple dashboards with similar requirements or purposes.

#### 11. Add Component

**Add Component** feature in a dashboard UI allows users to customize the visualization of the dashboard by adding new components that display specific types of data or information. These components may include charts, graphs, tables, or other visual elements that can be used to represent data in various formats. 

By using the Add Component feature, users can tailor the dashboard UI to their specific needs and requirements, and display the data in a way that is most meaningful to them.

#### 12. Refresh
The **Refresh** option in a dashboard UI allows the user to reload or refresh the displayed data according to their requirements. By refreshing the data in the dashboard UI the user can ensure that the data is up-to-date.

#### 13. Share

The **Share** feature enables users to share the dashboard by sharing a link to the dashboard UI. This can be particularly useful in situations where multiple members of the team need to be informed about the same information.

4. The **Recommended Dashboard** window will pop up. 

   :::note

   The **Recommended Dashboard** is a pre-designed dashboard based on the services running in your application.

   :::

5. Select the services as per the requirement.

6. Click the **`Apply`** button.

7. Metrics will be generated in the dashboard based on the services running in the system.
