# Introduction
## Overview

SnappyFlow's dashboard is a tool to display various types of visual data in one place. Usually, a dashboard is intended to convey different, but related information in an easy-to-digest form. And oftentimes, this includes things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important business metrics that stakeholders need to see and understand at a glance.

Dashboards are useful across different industries and verticals because they’re highly customizable. They can include data of all sorts with varying date ranges to help you understand: what happened, why it happened, what may happen, and what action you should take. And since dashboards use visualizations like [tables](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/reference-library/visual-analytics/tables), graphs, and [charts](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/reference-library/visual-analytics/charts), others who aren’t as close to the data can quickly and easily understand the story it tells or the insights it reveals.
