# Monitoring JAVA on Instances

## Overview

JVM on instances is monitored using [sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) configured with jvm plugin. The plugin monitors JVM metrics, jvm arguments used to start Java process and deadlock metrics. JVM plugin internally uses the following utilities to collect metrics: 

- **Jstats** for JVM metrics 
- **Jolokia** will be started by plugin to collect deadlock metrics if monitor Deadlocks parameter is set in configuration file 

 

## Pre-requisites

Jcmd has to be installed in the instance 

 

## Configuration 

[sfAgent](/docs/Quick_Start/getting_started#sfagent) section provides steps to install and automatically generate plugin configurations. User can also manually add the configuration shown below to config.yaml under `/opt/sfagent/` directory 

```yaml
- name: jvm 
  enabled: true 
  interval: 60 
  config: 
         process: *			#process that needs to be monitored 
         heapInterval: 3600		# polling interval to collect jvm arguments passed to the process 
         monitorDeadlocks: false	#enable/disable deadlock monitoring 
         deadLockMonitoringInterval: 300	#polling interval for deadlock monitoring. 
```

## Viewing data and dashboards 

-  Data generated by this plugin can be viewed in `browse data` page inside the respective application under `plugin=jvm` and `documentType=jvm` 

- Dashboard for this data can be instantiated by importing dashboard template `JVM` to the application dashboard.
